## Features
- Daily reward claim (Hoyolab)
- In-game statistics (characters, weapons)
- Wish history
- Fun commands

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to share how I coded my bot and inspire you guys. You can self-host the bot, but with a different name/brand, and I don't really recommend it because you are required to have the same database structure/data as me, which I'm not comfortable sharing (sorry).

## Setup
Clone this repo to your desktop and run `python -m launcher.py`.

You might want to look into `config.json` to make change the token and some informations such as database token, owner id, and etc.


## Usage
After you clone this repo and run the launcher.py, for commands help run `<prefix>help`, the default prefix for the bot is `>`, and customisable for every server (or atleast soon).
